## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

This project has a separate backend (Node.js/Express) and frontend (React) that must be started individually.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

#### Backend
```sh
cd backend
npm install
```

#### Frontend
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Servers
